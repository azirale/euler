My own solutions to the puzzles in Project Euler.

If you grab these solutions to use as your own or to get the solution values -- why bother with the puzzles at all?

The main solutions are in `probs.py` in sequential order. The script is meant to be run interactively.
The other modules have helpers for certain types of operations.

* Prime number generation - `primegen.py` 
* Working with (prime) factors  - `primefactors.py`
* Working with digits instead of values - `digits.py`
* Timing/Reporting - `utils.py`
